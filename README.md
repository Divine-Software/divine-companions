# The Divine Companions Monorepo

This is a collection of various companion modules for the Divine ecosystem, organized in a monorepo for convenience and
documentation purposes. The currently included modules are:

* [@divine/judgement]:          The Divine Judgement: Enforce TypeScript types at runtime.
* [@divine/judgement-cli]:      The Divine Judgement: Schema/Code generator CLI.
* [@divine/localization]:       The Divine Localization Library.

Candidates for migration to this monorepo in the future:

* [@divine/amd-loader]:         A no-magic, no-nonsense, static and synchronous AMD loader.
* [@divine/synchronization]:    The Divine Synchronization Library.
* [@divine/sysconsole]:         The Divine Syslog Console.

All web-related Divine modules are part of the [Divine Web Service Framework], which has a [monorepo][@divine/wsf] of
its own.
